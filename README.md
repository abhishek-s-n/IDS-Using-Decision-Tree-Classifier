# IDS-Decision-Tree

The IDS we will be developing is a network-based IDS that is programmed to detect any misuse of the network resources (misuse detection) i.e. it detects malicious 
packets flowing in a network. We will be building a classifier using Decision Trees. They help in increasing the accuracy at which intrusions are detected. Before 
building the classifier we will be required to select the most optimal features using Feature selection. We will be employing the concept of Recursive Feature 
Elimination(RFE).Because of RFE the attacks are detected more efficiently even in highly congested networks. It also leads to a lesser number of false positives 
and therefore a lower rate of false alarms. Also, The time taken to detect attacks can be cut down significantly by using databases for storage and the concept of 
Dynamic multi-boosting. The proposed network intrusion detection system can classify packets in real-time based on the packets collected from the networkflow.

# Proposed System Flow

The proposed approach consists of 4 fundamental stages:
1. Feature selection
2. Combining the optimal features
3. Building a classifier
4. Evaluation

# Software Used
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. sklearn
